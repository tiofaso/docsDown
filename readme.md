# Just for fun
This is a very simple script with no commitment to being anything more serious.

In my work, I often have to deal with documentation scattered in various places. 

I thought about the possibility of downloading Google Docs files to my HD so that I can process them later. So just for fun wrote this with Python (I'm currently studying it - I'm a Java/PHP guy), 

The idea is simple: input various Google Docs files IDs into a .dat file and let the script handle automatically.

As the idea is to keep it simple, I didn't want to use Google's Cloud version to access restricted files and other features. Therefore, the script only downloads files that are shared in public mode.

I hope this will be useful for you! :) 

Cheers,
